# Qpsmtpd logging plugin configuration
#
# This file has the same format as the main qpsmtpd plugins configuration
# (/etc/qpsmtpd/plugins), but is used exclusively to specify plugins used for
# logging (they must be configured separately, being initialized at a
# different time and used to indicate errors with all other plugins loaded
# afterward.)

# The file logging plugin logs to /var/log/qpsmtpd:
logging/file loglevel LOGINFO /var/log/qpsmtpd/qpsmtpd.log

# The syslog logging plugin logs to the syslog facility:
#
# logging/syslog loglevel LOGINFO

# The 'warn' plugin logs to STDERR via perl's warn():
#
# logging/warn LOGINFO

# The 'adaptive' plugin logs to STDERR via warn(), but does so according to
# different severity thresholds when a message is accepted or rejected
#
# logging/adaptive accept LOGINFO reject LOGWARN
