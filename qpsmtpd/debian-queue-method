# This is the qpsmtpd queue plugin selection generated by debconf at
# package installation.  It reflects the choice of queue method selected
# by the debconf UI.  Please do not edit it directly -- it will be overwritten
# on subsequent package upgrades.  To change the queueing/delivery 
# method, either run 'dpkg-reconfigure qpsmtpd' and pick a different method,
# or edit /etc/qpsmtpd/plugins to remove the $include reference to this file,
# then pick whatever queue plugin you prefer.
